# Installation

Stogram has a dedicated virtual machine called **Stogram Virtual Machine**, `SMachine`, which is a minimal and lightweight program for launching the program's core. The smachine will be installed on the underlying operating system upon which Stogram system will be run. This approach of managing a dedicated virtual machine for the stogram chat system ensures data protection and isolation from the underlying system, as such gives a chance of vulnerability, hence, defying the aims and objectives of Stogram

Within the **smachine** is the Stogram Kernel `SKernel` standing as the `Core` of Stogram. The skernel will be installed onto an external storage device, which is then called by smachine from here, ensuring every user has a separate Stogram envrionment.

Within the **skernel** resides the user's chat system (stogram file system). Hence, for installation, the stogram chat system image `stogram.img` has to be copied onto the external storage device to be used. Rebooting the system or reinserting the storage medium that now has the stogram.img, will effect a window, effected by smachine which is responsible for monitoring such events. Smachine will recognise the image, and attempt to install the **skernel** on the device. Thus the device has to be formatted into a file format stogram understands, **FAT** variants is recommended.

After successful installation, the stogram chat system is set to restart for complete initialization.
